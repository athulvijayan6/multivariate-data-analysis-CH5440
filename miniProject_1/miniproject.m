% Now x, y and z hold data in ECEF coordinates which are not denoised.

% We use csaps function of matlab

% The default value for the piecewise constant weight function Î» in the roughness measure is the constant function 1.
% is often near 1/(1 + h^3/6), with h the average spacing of the data sites.
