%If we convert the data to cartesian coordinates before denoising, the associated errors will also get scaled up
% So we will fit the latitude and longitude in a cubic spline
% By fitting the data in a cubic smoothing spline, we do a denoising
% Also by differentiating this, we get the angular velovity in theta and phi directions

% We use csaps function of matlab for fitting

% this does minimize sum(W*|y - f(x)|^2 + (1-p)*integral(lambda*|f''(t)|^2)dt)
% The default value for the piecewise constant weight function Î» in the roughness measure is the constant function 1.
% is often near 1/(1 + h^3/6), with h the average spacing of the data sites.
